## Installing

If you are about to obtain your own copy/fork of this bot complete the following steps:

1. Clone repo

    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/Singapore-Tech-Entrepreneurs/telegram_bot_for_admins.git
    ```

1. Install dependencies (you need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed)

    ```sh
    $ cd telegram_bot_for_admins
    $ npm install
    ```

1. Create `config.json` file (you have `config-example.json`, you can copy and edit it). Fill it with your bot api token and mongo connection string. To obtain         telegram bot token you may need to use [BotFather](http://t.me/BotFather). Free mongo database you can obtain at [mlab.com](http://mlab.com), for example.

    ```javascript
    {
        "bot_token": "<tokenFromBotFather>",
        "mongo_connection": "<mongoDBConnection>",
        "test_connection": "<mongoDBConnection>"
    }
    ```

1. Run it

    ```sh
    $ npm start
    ```

## Using

1. Add your bot to supergroup.
1. Promote him to admin
1. Activate bot by sending him any message.
1. Configure it by typing `/setting` right in your group. This step is important, because you can administer more than one group, so bot needs to know, what group you want to configure right now.
1. Bot will send you keyboard (in private message), that you can use to toggle message filters and more.
